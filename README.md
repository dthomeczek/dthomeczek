- Hello! I’m Devin Thomeczek, a graduated bachelor of science in computer science!
- I’m interested in software development and creating programs for use in conjunction with video games and Twitch streams (some of which are a work in progress), but I am overall interested in the software development lifecycle.
- I'm currently working on moving several previous assignments onto my GitHub from my previous university repositories. I’m also currently learning more about connectivity and packages in Python for use in developing Twitch chat gameplay functionality, along with expanding my knowledge past what was tought to me during my years in university.
- I’m looking to find a full-time software development position.
- You can reach me at devinthomeczek@gmail.com to inquire about my work!
